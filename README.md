# ROC
ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) for different classification thresholds. The TPR is also known as sensitivity and is defined as the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such by the model, while the FPR is defined as the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positives by the model. The ROC curve shows the tradeoff between TPR and FPR as the classification threshold is varied. A perfect classifier would have a ROC curve that passes through the top left corner (TPR=1 and FPR=0), while a random classifier would have a ROC curve that is a straight line from the bottom left corner to the top right corner.


# AUC

AUC is a metric that quantifies the overall performance of a classifier by computing the area under the ROC curve. AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where an AUC of 0.5 corresponds to a random classifier and an AUC of 1.0 corresponds to a perfect classifier. A higher AUC value indicates better performance of the classifier at distinguishing between positive and negative examples.

__AUC is often used as a single-number summary of a classifier's performance__, as it is more robust to class imbalance and different threshold choices than other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

# When and Why to use?

ROC and AUC are important evaluation metrics in machine learning for binary classification tasks, as they provide valuable insights into the performance of a classifier and can help in various ways:

- __Model selection__

    ROC and AUC can help in selecting the best model among multiple classifiers. A classifier with a higher AUC score is generally considered to be better at distinguishing between positive and negative examples and may be preferred over other models with lower AUC scores.

- __Threshold tuning__

    ROC and AUC can help in selecting an optimal threshold for classification. The ROC curve shows the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity at different threshold values, allowing the user to choose a threshold that balances the two measures depending on their specific needs.

- __Performance comparison__

    ROC and AUC provide a standardized way to compare the performance of different classifiers on the same dataset. A higher AUC score indicates better performance, regardless of the specifics of the classifiers or the dataset.

- __Robustness to class imbalance__
    
    ROC and AUC are more robust to class imbalance than other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. This is because they focus on the tradeoff between true positives and false positives, which is less affected by class imbalance.

Overall, ROC and AUC are valuable tools for evaluating, selecting, and tuning binary classification models in machine learning.

# Disadvantages
There are also some disadvantages to using the ROC curve and AUC as evaluation metrics:

- __Limited to binary classification__
   
   The ROC curve and AUC are only applicable to binary classification problems and cannot be used for multi-class classification.

- __Sensitivity to dataset size and imbalance__
   
   The ROC curve and AUC can be sensitive to the size and imbalance of the dataset, particularly when the number of positive or negative examples is small.

- __Interpretability__
    
    The ROC curve and AUC do not provide direct insight into the underlying decision boundary or the relative importance of different features in the classifier.

Overall, the benefits of the ROC curve and AUC as evaluation metrics in machine learning outweigh their disadvantages, and they are widely used in binary classification tasks.
